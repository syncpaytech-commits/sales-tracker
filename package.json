Great! You have the files, but you need to install pnpm first. Let's do this step by step:
Step 1: Install pnpm
Bash
npm install -g pnpm
(If you don't have npm, install Node.js first from https://nodejs.org )
Step 2: Run pnpm install
Bash
pnpm install
Step 3: Add all changes and push
Bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update lockfile and add Supabase files"
git push origin main
OR - Skip Local Setup (Easier!)
Since you're having local setup issues, let's just fix it in Railway settings instead:
In Railway Dashboard:
Click on your service
Click Settings (left sidebar)
Scroll down to Build Command
Change it to:
Plain Text
pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile && pnpm run build
Click outside the box to save
Go back to Deployments tab
Click the three dots on the failed deployment
Click Redeploy
I recommend the Railway settings fix - it's much faster and doesn't require installing anything locally!
Want to try the Railway settings fix?
Custom Build Command
Override the default build command that is run when building your app
Perfect! You found the Custom Build Command setting!
Here's What to Do:
1. Enter This Command:
In the "Custom Build Command" field, paste:
Plain Text
pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile && pnpm run build
2. Save It
Click outside the text box or press Enter to save
3. Also Check Start Command
Scroll down a bit more and look for "Custom Start Command"
If you see it, set it to:
Plain Text
pnpm start
4. Redeploy
Go back to the Deployments tab (top of the page)
Find your failed deployment
Click the three dots (•••) next to it
Click Redeploy
Railway will now rebuild with the new command that allows updating the lockfile!
Let me know when you click Redeploy and I'll help you watch for success! 🚀
same error
Hmm, that's strange. Let me try a different approach.
The Real Issue:
The problem is that your GitHub repo has modified files that weren't committed. Railway is pulling the old version without the Supabase files.
Let's Fix This Properly:
Option 1: Commit Your Changes (Best Solution)
Even without pnpm locally, you can still commit:
Bash
cd ~/Downloads/sales-tracker-railway-final

# Install Node.js package manager (npm) if needed
npm install -g pnpm

# Or use npm instead
npm install

# Commit all changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add Supabase integration"
git push origin main
Option 2: Use npm Instead of pnpm
Change Railway settings to use npm:
Build Command:
Plain Text
npm install && npm run build
Start Command:
Plain Text
npm start
Then redeploy.
Option 3: Delete and Re-upload to GitHub
Delete the current repo on GitHub
Create a new repo
Extract the zip file fresh
Push everything:
Bash
cd ~/Downloads
unzip gChwEBXNGuqWkDlQ.zip -d fresh-extract
cd fresh-extract
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/sales-tracker-backend.git
git push -u origin main
Which option do you want to try? I recommend Option 2 (use npm ) - it's the quickest!
just tell me what to do?
Do This Now:
Step 1: Change Railway to Use npm
In Railway:
Go to Settings
Find Custom Build Command
Change it to:
Plain Text
npm install && npm run build
Find Custom Start Command
Change it to:
Plain Text
npm start
Step 2: Redeploy
Go to Deployments tab
Click the three dots (•••) on the failed deployment
Click Redeploy
That's it. Do those 2 steps and tell me if it works.

same error

youve fucked the project
I understand you're frustrated. Let me fix this properly right now.
The issue is that Railway is still using pnpm (not npm) because of the pnpm-lock.yaml file in your repo.
FINAL FIX - Do This:
Step 1: Delete pnpm-lock.yaml from GitHub
In Terminal:
Bash
cd ~/Downloads/sales-tracker-railway-final
rm pnpm-lock.yaml
git add pnpm-lock.yaml
git commit -m "Remove pnpm lockfile"
git push origin main
Step 2: Railway Will Auto-Redeploy
Railway will detect the change and automatically redeploy using npm instead.
OR - Start Fresh (5 Minutes)
If you want to completely start over:
Download the zip again: https://files.manuscdn.com/user_upload_by_module/session_file/310519663286194886/gChwEBXNGuqWkDlQ.zip
Extract it to a NEW folder
Delete the old GitHub repo
Create a new GitHub repo
Push the fresh code
Connect to Railway
Which do you want: Fix the current one OR start completely fresh?
pnpm install

 ERR_PNPM_PATCH_NOT_APPLIED  The following patches were not applied: wouter@3.7.1
Either remove them from "patchedDependencies" or update them to match packages in your dependencies.
ERROR: failed to build: failed to solve: process "pnpm install" did not complete successfully: exit code: 1
Now I see the real problem! There's a patch for wouter in the package.json that doesn't exist.
Quick Fix:
Step 1: Remove the Patch
In Terminal:
Bash
cd ~/Downloads/sales-tracker-railway-final
Open package.json in any text editor and find this section:
JSON
"pnpm": {
  "patchedDependencies": {
    "wouter@3.7.1": "patches/wouter@3.7.1.patch"
  }
}
Delete that entire "pnpm" section.
Save the file.
Step 2: Push to GitHub
Bash
git add package.json
git commit -m "Remove wouter patch"
git push origin main
Railway will auto-redeploy.
OR - I Can Give You a Fixed package.json
If you can't edit the file, I can create a corrected version for you to download and replace.
Which do you prefer: edit it yourself OR I give you a fixed file?
yes give me correct version
Creating the fixed package.json for you now...
Found the root issue: a patch in `package.json` for `wouter` doesn't exist. I'll remove the patch, update `package.json`, and push the fix for successful deployment. Next, will prepare the corrected `package.json`.

✅ Fixed package.json Ready!
Download the attached file and replace your current package.json.
What to Do:
Step 1: Download the Fixed File
Download package-fixed.json (attached above)
Step 2: Replace Your package.json
Bash
cd ~/Downloads/sales-tracker-railway-final
mv ~/Downloads/package-fixed.json package.json
Or just:
Delete your current package.json
Rename the downloaded package-fixed.json to package.json
Move it into the sales-tracker-railway-final folder
Step 3: Push to GitHub
Bash
git add package.json
git commit -m "Fix package.json"
git push origin main
Railway will automatically redeploy!
The fix: I removed the broken wouter patch that was causing the error.

How was this result?
now what I do with this file?
Replace Your Old package.json:
Step 1: Find the Downloaded File
The file package-fixed.json is in your Downloads folder.
Step 2: Go to Your Project Folder
Open Finder → Go to Downloads → Find sales-tracker-railway-final folder
Step 3: Replace the File
In the sales-tracker-railway-final folder, find package.json
Delete the old package.json
Rename package-fixed.json to package.json
Move it into the sales-tracker-railway-final folder (if it's not already there)
Step 4: Push to GitHub
Open Terminal:
Bash
cd ~/Downloads/sales-tracker-railway-final
git add package.json
git commit -m "Fix package.json"
git push origin main
Or Do It in Terminal (Easier):
Just copy-paste these commands:
Bash
cd ~/Downloads/sales-tracker-railway-final
cp ~/Downloads/package-fixed.json package.json
git add package.json
git commit -m "Fix package.json"
git push origin main
Railway will automatically detect the change and redeploy!
yes but its in github 
Right! You need to update the file on GitHub. Here's how:
Option 1: Edit Directly on GitHub (Easiest)
Go to your repo: https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/sales-tracker-backend
Click on package.json
Click the pencil icon (Edit this file )
Delete everything in the file
Copy ALL the text from the package-fixed.json file I gave you
Paste it into the GitHub editor
Scroll down and click Commit changes
Railway will auto-redeploy!
Option 2: Push from Terminal
Bash
cd ~/Downloads/sales-tracker-railway-final
cp ~/Downloads/package-fixed.json package.json
git add package.json
git commit -m "Fix package.json"
git push origin main
I recommend Option 1 (edit on GitHub) - it's faster and you don't need Terminal!
Want to try Option 1?
